            <p>I'm a housewife and a mother of 3. RemindMe! was first introduced
                to me by a friend of mine. I've been using it for 2 years now. because of remind me
                for the past two years I've never missed a school event or a bill payment.
                RemindMe! makes my everyday life very easy.
                I would recommend this website to anyone who wants to organize their work according to their events.

            <p>I work in coroperate sector. So everyday i deal with alot of people through meetings and events.
                in the begining of my career it was hard for me to remember all my events and meetings.So I missed alot
                of them.
                After I found RemindMe! everything changed. RemindMe! sends you reminders so you never miss a meeting or
                an event.
                Thank You RemindMe! for helping me.
